You are building a production-ready Inspection Reporting and Management web application from scratch. The GitHub remote URL is: https://github.com/pingud98/prototoolagain.git

---

## TECH STACK

- Language: Python 3.11+
- Web Framework: Flask (with Flask-Login, Flask-WTF, Flask-SQLAlchemy)
- Database: SQLite via SQLAlchemy ORM
- PDF Generation: WeasyPrint (A4-formatted output)
- TLS/HTTPS: Self-signed certificate via trustme or mkcert for local hosting
- Frontend: Jinja2 templates + Tailwind CSS (via CDN) + vanilla JS
- Auth: Bcrypt password hashing, session-based login
- File Storage: Local filesystem under /uploads/, referenced in DB

## DATABASE MODELS

### User
- id, username, full_name, email, password_hash, is_admin, is_active, created_at

### Inspection
- id, installation_name, location, inspection_date, version (int, starts at 1),
  reference_number (int), observations, conclusion_text,
  conclusion_status (enum: ok / minor / major),
  created_by (FK User), created_at, updated_at

### InspectionInspector
- id, inspection_id (FK), user_id (FK nullable), free_text_name (nullable)
  (Supports both registered users and free-text names)

### Photo
- id, inspection_id (FK), filename, caption,
  action_required (enum: none / urgent / before_next), uploaded_at

---

## SETUP SCRIPT (setup.py)

The setup script must:
1. Install all dependencies from requirements.txt using pip
2. Generate a self-signed TLS certificate and key, saved to certs/
3. Create the SQLite database and run all table migrations
4. Prompt the admin for: username, full name, email, password (with confirmation)
5. Create the admin account with is_admin=True
6. Print a success message with the local HTTPS URL (e.g. https://localhost:5000)
7. Be runnable with: python setup.py

---

## CORE FEATURES

### Authentication
- Login page (username + password)
- Session-based auth with Flask-Login
- All routes protected — redirect to login if not authenticated
- Logout route
- No self-registration — admin creates all accounts

### Admin Panel (/admin)
- List all users
- Create new user (username, full name, email, password, admin toggle)
- Edit user (change name, email, reset password, toggle active/admin)
- Deactivate (not delete) users
- Only accessible to is_admin=True users

### Dashboard (/)
- Table of all inspections the logged-in user has access to
- Columns: Reference No., Installation Name, Location, Date, Version, Conclusion Status, Actions
- Actions: View, Edit, Export PDF
- "New Inspection" button

### Inspection Form (/inspection/new and /inspection/<id>/edit)

Fields:
1. Installation Name — text input
2. Location — text input
3. Date of Inspection — date picker
4. Version — auto-incremented integer (display only, not editable)
5. Reference Number — integer input
6. Inspector(s) — pre-filled with logged-in user's full name; allow adding more via:
   - Dropdown of registered users
   - Free-text field for external individuals
   - Display as removable tags/chips
7. Observations — large textarea
8. Photos section:
   - Upload multiple photos
   - For each uploaded photo display a thumbnail
   - Per-photo fields: caption (text), action_required (radio buttons):
       "No action required"
       "Urgent action required"
       "Action required before next inspection"
   - Ability to remove photos
9. Conclusion section:
   - Conclusion comments textarea
   - Radio buttons (select exactly one):
       OK for operation in current state
       Minor comments — Remedial actions required for continued operation
       Major comments — Operation suspended until resolution and satisfactory follow-up inspection

Buttons:
- New inspection: "Complete Report" → saves, sets version=1, redirects to view page
- Edit existing: "Update Report" → saves, increments version by 1, redirects to view page
- Cancel → returns to dashboard

### Inspection View (/inspection/<id>)
- Read-only formatted view of the report
- Shows all fields, photos (with captions and action status), inspectors, conclusion
- "Edit Report" button
- "Export as PDF" button

---

## PDF EXPORT (/inspection/<id>/pdf)

- Generated using WeasyPrint
- Formatted for A4 pages
- Include:
  - App name / report title header
  - All inspection fields in a clean two-column layout
  - Inspector names listed
  - Observations in a clearly delineated box
  - Photos displayed in a grid (max 2 per row), each with caption and action status clearly labelled
  - Conclusion section with selected status prominently displayed
  - Footer with page number and generation timestamp
- Flows naturally across multiple A4 pages if content requires it
- Served as a file download: inspection_report_<ref>_v<version>.pdf

---

## SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

- All passwords hashed with bcrypt (min cost factor 12)
- CSRF protection on all forms via Flask-WTF
- File uploads validated: only JPEG, PNG, GIF, WEBP accepted; max 10MB per file
- Uploaded filenames sanitised with werkzeug.utils.secure_filename and stored with UUID prefix
- User input escaped in all templates (Jinja2 autoescaping enabled)
- Admin routes protected with both login_required and admin_required decorators
- Secret key loaded from environment variable SECRET_KEY or auto-generated and saved to .env on first run
- HTTPS enforced — Flask run with SSL context using certs from certs/
- .env and *.db and certs/ added to .gitignore

---

## GITHUB INSTRUCTIONS

- The repository already exists and has been initialised with prior commits
- Completely discard all prior history
- Use git checkout --orphan new-branch, add all files, commit, then force-push to main
- Commit message: "Initial commit: Inspection reporting app"
- Include a comprehensive README.md with:
  - Project overview
  - Requirements (Python version, OS)
  - Setup instructions (python setup.py)
  - How to run (python run.py)
  - How to access (HTTPS URL)
  - Notes on the self-signed certificate browser warning

---

## CODE QUALITY STANDARDS

- All Python files include docstrings
- Routes grouped into Blueprints
- No hardcoded secrets
- Database access only via SQLAlchemy ORM — no raw SQL
- Error pages for 403, 404, 500
- Flash messages for all user actions (success and error)
- Logging to a rotating file log (logs/app.log)

---

## EXECUTION ORDER

Build in this order:
1. requirements.txt and config.py
2. app/models.py
3. app/__init__.py (app factory)
4. Auth blueprint + templates
5. Admin blueprint + templates
6. Inspection blueprint + form + view templates
7. PDF export utility + route
8. setup.py
9. run.py
10. README.md
11. .gitignore
12. GitHub force-push

Do not proceed to the next step until the current one is complete and internally consistent.
